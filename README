# Project Name

This project includes a React.js front end for a task manager application. Please note the following:

## Front End (React)

- The front end code is located in the `src` folder.
- To run the front end:
  1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
  2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
  3. Start the application with `npm start`.

## Back End (Server and Database)

- The back end, including server and database connectivity, is a work in progress.
- While code for connecting to a SQLite database is provided in `server.js`, it hasn't been fully implemented due to time constraints and a lack of knowledge in SQL database connectivity.
- The code for the backend is located in another branch 'backend'
